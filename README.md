# Flight Analysis
Project for Correlation 1's Data Science for All Women's Summit Modelling Flight Delay

Using a Random Forest Classifier I attempt to predict if a flight will be delayed or not.
Final model has a recall of 60% and a precision of 30% for delayed flights.
See attached Jupyter Notebook for all of the details. You can view the presentation slides here: http://bit.ly/Correlation1FlightAnalysis
